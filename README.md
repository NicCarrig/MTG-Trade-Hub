# MTG Trade Hub
# Project 2 - Interactive Full-Stack Application

## Description
MTG Trade Hub is an application used to track and maintain a user's collection for Magic: The Gathering cards. It also allows the user to interact with other users to set up trades for their cards through a posting system. Ideally the user can post a card or cards they are looking for and other users will then respond to that post with their own comments. By clicking on either the poster's username or one of the commenter's, the user can view the cards that the other users have added to their trade inventory.
